# Gradient Descent Algorithms

In this note, I will introduce the mathematical foundations of gradient descent algorithms, with a focus on analyzing the convergence rate of these algorithms for convex optimization problems.

Basically, I will walk you through the relevant definitions, theorems, and proofs step by step. I hope this note can help you (and me) better understand the mathematical foundations of gradient descent algorithms. 

The note is organized as follows:
- **Preliminaries** (Page 2)
    - Derectional Derivative
    - Mean Value Theorem
    - Taylor's Theorem
    - Eigenvalues Properties
    - Vector Norm and Matrix Norm
    - Loewner Order
- **Convexity** (Page 3)
    - Definition
    - Strong Convexity
    - Properties
- **L-smoothness** (Page 3)
    - Definition
    - Properties
- **Gradient Descent Algorithms** (Page 4)
    - Gradient Descent
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent
    - Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent
    - Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum
        - Polyak's Momentum
        - Nesterov's Momentum


### Note to Readers
This note is still under construction. I will keep updating it. If you find any mistakes or have any suggestions, please feel free to contact me. Thank you!

Hope you aren't scared by the math symbols. :sweat_smile:

## Preliminaries
Here are some basic concepts and theorems that will be used in the following sections. (Most of them are used in proofs.) I only provide the definitions and theorems here. If you want to know more about them, you can check the references at the end of this note.

If you are already familiar with them, or you just assume them to be true (life is too short to prove everything, right?), you can skip this section and go to the next page directly.

### Directional Derivative

### Mean Value Theorem

### Taylor's Theorem

### Eigenvalues Properties

### Vector Norm and Matrix Norm

### Loewner Order

### Note to Readers
Congratulations! You have finished reading the first part. :tada:

If you still want to continue, next page is about function properties, including convexity and L-smoothness. Go! :point_right:
